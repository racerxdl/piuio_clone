PIUIO Board Clone
===========

This is a clone of the original Pump It Up USB IO Board running on an Arduino.
It uses the usbdrv library modified for running with Arduino IDE (version <= 1.0.5)


It's thinked for running with OpenITG and StepMania and it can handle all cabinet and pads lights.

#Instructions for use  
Download Arduino IDE <= 1.0.5  
Copy usbdrv folder in Arduino IDE's libraries folder  
Copy usbconfig.h (from Arduino_Uno if you want to run the code on Arduino Uno; choose Mega otherwise) to just copied usbdrv folder and replace the existing one  
Build the circuit like the schematic(released soon)  
Run Arduino IDE and open the projects  
Load the program on the arduino  
Connect the board to your pc with the USB of the circuit  
Connect the cables to your DDR Cabinet  
Enjoy!!   
  
The program doesn't run on Arduino Pro Mini: it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting but i don't know why.
